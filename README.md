# Bonifatus - School Grades Bonus Calculator

## Project Vision

Bonifatus is a Progressive Web Application that helps parents motivate their children's academic performance through a transparent, gamified bonus points system. The app transforms grades into tangible rewards, creating clear goals and fostering positive learning habits while maintaining complete data privacy and child safety.

---

## What is Bonifatus?

**The Problem**: Parents struggle to effectively motivate children academically in a transparent, fair manner that adapts to different grading systems and family values.

**The Solution**: A secure, customizable platform where:

- Children enter their grades from school tests and exams
- The system automatically calculates bonus points based on performance
- Parents can customize how different factors (grade quality, class level, term type, subject importance) affect rewards
- Families track academic progress over time with visual analytics
- Parents define a reward catalog (toys, privileges, experiences) that children can "purchase" with earned points

**Key Differentiators**:

- Works with any international grading system (A-F, 1-6, percentages, etc.)
- Child-safe platform with COPPA and GDPR compliance
- Offline-capable Progressive Web App (works on all devices)
- Free forever with no hidden costs
- Privacy-first: your family data never leaves secure, encrypted storage
