    "faqNoResults": "No questions match your search. Try different keywords.",
    "faq1Q": "What is Bonifatus?",
    "faq1A": "Bonifatus is a free platform that helps families turn academic grades into structured bonus rewards. Parents and children create accounts, link them together, and use the smart calculator to convert grades from any grading system into bonus points. Parents then choose how to settle those points — as cash, gift vouchers, savings deposits, or even ETF investments.",
    "faq2Q": "How does the bonus calculator work?",
    "faq2A": "Enter your grading system, class level, and term type, then add subjects and grades. The calculator normalizes each grade to a 0–100 scale, assigns a tier (best, good, fair, below), and multiplies by configurable class level and term type factors. The result is a transparent bonus point total that both parents and children can understand.",
    "faq3Q": "What grading systems are supported?",
    "faq3A": "Bonifatus supports grading systems from around the world including German 1–6, Swiss 1–6, Austrian 1–5, American A–F, British GCSE 9–1, French 0–20, percentage-based systems, and many more. Each system is accurately mapped to a normalized scale for fair bonus calculation.",
    "faq4Q": "How do parent-child connections work?",
    "faq4A": "A parent generates a 6-digit invite code or QR code from their dashboard. The child enters this code on their profile page. Once linked, the parent can view the child's saved grades, settle rewards, and customize bonus factors. Either party can remove the connection at any time.",
    "faq5Q": "How are bonus points calculated?",
    "faq5A": "Bonus points use the formula: class level factor × term type factor × grade tier factor × subject weight. Grade tiers are: Best (≥75%), Good (50–74%), Fair (25–49%), Below (<25%). Parents can customize all factors from Settings. Final terms and higher class levels typically earn more points.",
    "faq6Q": "What are the reward settlement options?",
    "faq6A": "Five options: Cash or pocket money (in person), Bank transfer (to the child's account), Gift vouchers (Amazon, Apple, Steam, Netflix, and more), Savings account (junior deposit), and Investment/ETF (long-term compound growth). Parents can even split a single payout across multiple methods.",
    "faq7Q": "Is Bonifatus free to use?",
    "faq7A": "Yes! Bonifatus is completely free for all core features including the calculator, grade saving, parent-child connections, insights, and reward settlements. A Pro tier with advanced features is planned for the future.",
    "faq8Q": "How do I create an account?",
    "faq8A": "Click Sign Up, choose your role (parent or student), fill in your details, and verify your email with a 6-digit code. You will be automatically logged in after verification. Children must be at least 5 years old to register.",
    "faq9Q": "Is my data secure?",
    "faq9A": "Yes. Passwords are hashed with bcrypt, sessions use encrypted JWT tokens, and all data is stored on servers in Germany. We use Cloudflare Turnstile for bot protection and TLS encryption for all connections. We never sell your data and comply with GDPR.",
    "faq10Q": "Can I use Bonifatus on my phone?",
    "faq10A": "Absolutely! Bonifatus is a Progressive Web App (PWA) that works on any device — phone, tablet, or desktop. You can install it on your home screen for an app-like experience with offline capability.",
    "faq11Q": "How does the report card scanner work?",
    "faq11A": "Upload or photograph a report card, and our OCR engine extracts subjects and grades automatically. Review and correct any mismatches, then save directly to your profile. Currently supports German and English report cards.",
    "faq12Q": "What languages are supported?",
    "faq12A": "Bonifatus is available in 6 languages: English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, and Russian. You can switch languages anytime from the navigation menu.",
    "faq13Q": "How do I customize bonus factors?",
    "faq13A": "Parents can customize factors in Settings under Bonus Calculation. Adjust grade tier values, term type multipliers, and class level factors — per child or as defaults for all children. Students see a read-only view of their parent's settings.",
    "faq14Q": "What is the investment simulator?",
    "faq14A": "The investment simulator helps parents visualize how regularly investing bonus rewards could grow over time. Choose between a savings plan with compound interest or an ETF simulation using historical market data to see projected portfolio growth.",
    "faq15Q": "Can I delete my account and data?",
    "faq15A": "Yes. Go to Profile, scroll to Danger Zone, and click Delete account. This permanently removes your account and all associated data including grades, connections, and settlements. This action cannot be undone.",
    "faq16Q": "How do quick grades work?",
    "faq16A": "Quick grades let students log individual test scores as they come in, without creating a full term report. Parents can see unsettled quick grades and settle them in the Rewards section. Great for ongoing tracking between report cards.",
    "faq17Q": "What is the difference between term types?",
    "faq17A": "Midterm and Quarterly are intermediate assessments with a 0.5× bonus multiplier. Semester and Final are end-of-period assessments with a full 1× multiplier. Higher multipliers mean more bonus points for the same grades.",
    "faq18Q": "How do I reset my password?",
    "faq18A": "Click Forgot password on the login page, enter your email, and you will receive a 6-digit reset code. Enter the code along with a new password that is at least 12 characters with uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and a special character.",
    "faq19Q": "Can multiple parents connect to one child?",
    "faq19A": "Yes! A child can be connected to multiple parents, and each parent can have multiple children connected. Each parent can customize their own bonus factors independently for each child.",
    "faq20Q": "Is Bonifatus GDPR compliant?",
    "faq20A": "Yes. Bonifatus is operated from Germany and fully complies with the EU General Data Protection Regulation. Your data is stored on German servers, we only collect what is necessary for the service, and you have full rights to access, correct, export, and delete your data at any time."
