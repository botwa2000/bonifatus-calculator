# Bonifatus Security Architecture

## Document Purpose

This document outlines the comprehensive security strategy for Bonifatus, including threat modeling, security controls, attack prevention mechanisms, and compliance requirements. Security is a top priority given the application handles data about children.

---

## Security Principles

### Defense in Depth

Multiple layers of security controls ensure that if one layer fails, others prevent compromise.

### Principle of Least Privilege

Users and systems only have the minimum permissions needed to perform their functions.

### Security by Default

All features secure by default, requiring explicit action to reduce security.

### Privacy by Design

Privacy considerations integrated from the start, not added afterward.

### Zero Trust Architecture

Never trust, always verify - all requests authenticated and authorized.

**Rationale**: Strong passwords prevent credential compromise

#### Email Verification

**Process**:

1. User registers with email and password
2. Account created but marked unverified
3. Verification email sent with unique token
4. User clicks link to verify email
5. Token validated and account activated
6. Unverified accounts deleted after 7 days

**Implementation**:

- Verification tokens cryptographically random
